## Simulated Journal of a College Student

**October 1st:**

Today was the first day of October, and I felt surprisingly energized. I managed to get to my 8 am class on time, which is a miracle for me.  Professor Lee's lecture on Romantic poetry was actually pretty interesting, and I even participated in the discussion. Later, I grabbed lunch with Sarah and Mark, and we laughed a lot. It was a good reminder of why I love being here. I spent the evening catching up on some reading, feeling productive and content.  Maybe this semester will be different, maybe I can actually stay on top of things.

**October 2nd:**

Woke up feeling a little blah today.  Skipped my morning class because I just couldn't bring myself to get out of bed.  Spent most of the day scrolling through social media, feeling vaguely envious of everyone else's seemingly perfect lives.  Went to the library later, but couldn't focus on my assignments.  Ended up just staring out the window, lost in thought. I feel a little restless, like I should be doing something, but I can't figure out what.

**October 5th:**

Had a pretty good day.  Aced my midterm in psychology, which was a huge relief.  Celebrated with pizza and a movie with Sarah. We talked about our future plans, and for a moment, I felt excited about what's to come. However, later in the evening, that familiar feeling of emptiness crept back in. It's like a subtle hum in the background, always there, threatening to take over.

**October 8th:**

Feeling overwhelmed.  So much work piling up.  I keep procrastinating, which only makes it worse.  I snapped at Sarah today when she asked if I wanted to study together.  I feel bad about it, but I just wanted to be alone. I just want to curl up in bed and disappear.

**October 12th:**

Another day, another wave of apathy.  Skipped class again.  Barely ate anything.  Just stayed in my room, watching mindless videos.  I know I should be doing something productive, but I just lack the motivation. Everything feels pointless.

**October 15th:**

Forced myself to go to the gym today.  It was hard to get started, but I felt a little better afterwards.  Ran into Mark at the dining hall and we chatted for a bit.  It was nice to have a normal conversation with someone.  Still feeling a bit down, but the exercise helped, I guess.

**October 18th:**

The anxiety is back.  I have a presentation due next week and I haven’t even started working on it.  I feel like I’m drowning in responsibilities.  I can't seem to concentrate on anything. My chest feels tight, and I keep having these random bursts of panic.

**October 21st:**

Somehow managed to get through the presentation.  It wasn't my best work, but it's over, and that's all that matters.  Feeling drained, both physically and emotionally. I just want to sleep for a week.

**October 24th:**

Another low day.  The smallest things seem to irritate me.  I snapped at my roommate for leaving dishes in the sink.  I feel like I’m constantly on edge.  I haven’t talked to my parents in days. I don't want them to worry.

**October 27th:**

Everything feels grey.  I can't remember the last time I genuinely enjoyed something.  I'm starting to isolate myself.  I keep declining invitations from my friends.  I just want to be left alone.

**October 30th:**

Woke up with a heavy feeling in my chest.  I feel like I’m trapped in a fog.  I can’t shake this feeling of sadness and emptiness.  I know something is wrong, but I don’t know what to do.  Maybe I should talk to someone.  Maybe…


**October 31st:**

Halloween.  Everyone's out celebrating, but I’m stuck in my room. I just can't bring myself to care about anything. I feel numb.  I need help. I just don’t know where to start.
