# Multi-Agent LLM for Cognitive Distortion and Mood Screening  

## Environment Setup  
This project runs on **Google Colab**. Ensure you have access to Colab for running the notebooks.  

## Files  
- **[Journal Generator.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1seJBtV8bknMxI2Hp8vxURWFwn5u8sSf5?usp=sharing)** – Generates a simulated month-long journal with varied emotional tones.  
- **[Multi Agent Screening.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mZHELhkJpRcCDHkSdmyvMNcTlvy4G-Jh?usp=sharing)** – Uses a Multi-Agent LLM to analyze journal entries for cognitive distortions and mood trends.  
- **[journal_entry.txt](journal_entry.txt)** – Sample journal file for testing the model.  

## Project Overview  
This project explores how a **Multi-Agent LLM** detects **cognitive distortions** and **mood fluctuations** in a simulated month-long individual journal. The goal is to develop a **preemptive strategy** for identifying and managing **depression and anxiety**, offering insights into mental health trends over time.
